##### Helping students find teams and projects that match their skill level
##### Providing resources intelligently for each project 
>> Just start contributing to open source projects.  
>> \- Every developer to beginners asking for advice  

Here at Open Campus, we understand that university students aren't typically equipped to contribute to projects on GitHub. 
- GitHub Explore:
  - Massive, established repositories
  - Largely professional projects with professional-level issues
  - Requires strong understanding of the source material
- Open Campus:
  - **Match with teammates & projects of *your* skill** level at your university
  - Easily **install dependencies** with the click of a button
  - Browse **intelligently curated resources** based on project content (frameworks, plugins, etc.)
